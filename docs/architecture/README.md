# Architecture

## Concept

What weâ€™re focused on is **high availability**, **high scalability**, and **high-cost performance ratio** because unstructured data which have been exponentially increasing day by day, and we needed to more efficiently manage objects to find values from tons of raw data.

## Architecture Overview

We succeeded in designing and implementing LeoFS as simple as possible. LeoFS consists of three components, [LeoManager](leo_manager.md), [LeoStorage](leo_storage.md), and [LeoGateway](leo_gateway.md). The role of each component is clearly defined.

What we also carefully desined LeoFS is three things:

* To keep running LeoFS without SPOF
* To keep maintaining high performance regardless of the kind of data and amount data
* To provide easy administration by the LeoFS' CLI, [leofs-adm](https://github.com/leo-project/leofs/blob/master/leofs-adm)
