## Amazon S3 Interface
### Amazon S3 Official Documentation

* [AWS Documentation / Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) / Developer Guide / What Is Amazon S3?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html)

### How to determine the name of Bucket

* [Virtual Hosting of Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html)
* Values used for determining the name:
	* S3 uses a HTTP host header or a path segment in the HTTP request line
	* How S3 determines what to use depends on a domain name

#### 1. https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/path_to_file

In this case, a bucket's name is the first segment of a path.


| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| Request line | GET /bucket/path_to_file HTTP/1.1 |
| Host header| Host: s3.amazonaws.com |


#### 2. https://www.example.com.s3.amazonaws.com/path_to_file

In this case, the name of the bucket is the part of the domain name before `.s3.amazonaws.com`.

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| Request line | GET /path_to_file HTTP/1.1 |
| Host header| Host: www.example.com.s3.amazonaws.com |


#### 3. https://www.example.com/path_to_file

In this case, a bucket's name is equal to the `FQDN`.

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| Request line | GET /path_to_file HTTP/1.1 |
| Host header | Host header |

The argument of LeoFSâ€™ `whereis` OR `purge` commands should be "www.example.com/path_to_file".


### Naming Rule of a Bucket

We recommend as a best practice that you always use DNS-compliant bucket names regardless of the region in which you create the bucket.

* Bucket names can be as long as between 3 and 255 characters.
* Bucket names can contain lowercase letters, numbers, periods (.), dashes (-) and underscores (_).
* Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.5.4).
* Bucket name cannot start and end with periods (.), dashes (-) and underscores (_).
