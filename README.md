## Overview

LeoFS is a highly available, distributed, eventually consistent object/blob store.
If you are searching a storage system that is able to store huge amount and various kind of files such as photo, movie, log data and so on, LeoFS is suitable for that.

LeoFS is supporting the following features:

* **Multi Protocol**
  * **S3-API Support**
      * LeoFS is an Amazon S3 compatible storage system.
      * Switch to LeoFS to decrease your cost from more expensive public-cloud solutions.
  * **REST-API Support**
      * To easily access LeoFS with [REST-API](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/admin/protocols/rest/)
  * **NFS Support**
      * NFS support was provided from LeoFS v1.1, the current status of which is beta.
* **Large Object Support**
  * LeoFS covers handling large size objects.
* **Multi Data Center Replication**
  * LeoFS is a highly scalable, fault-tolerant distributed file system without SPOF.
  * LeoFS's cluster can be viewed as a huge capacity storage. It consists of a set of loosely connected nodes.
  * We can build a global scale storage system with easy operations

## Architecture

![leofs-architecture-1](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/assets/leofs-architecture.0012.jpg)

LeoFS consists of three core components - [LeoStorage](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_storage/), [LeoGateway](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_gateway/) and [LeoManager](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_manager/) which depend on Erlang.

[LeoGateway](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_gateway/) handles http-request and http-response from any clients when using REST-API OR S3-API. Also, it is already built in the object-cache mechanism (memory and disk cache).

[LeoStorage](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_storage/) handles GET, PUT and DELETE objects as well as metadata. Also, it has replicator, recoverer and queueing mechanism in order to keep running a storage node and realise eventual consistency.

[LeoManager](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_manager/) always monitors LeoGateway and LeoStorage nodes. The main monitoring status are Node status and RINGâ€™s checksum in order to realise to keep high availability and keep data consistency.

You can access a LeoFS system using Amazon S3 clients and the SDK</a>.

## Build LeoFS with LeoFS Packages

LeoFS packages have been already provided on the Web. You're able to easily install LeoFS on your environments.

* LeoProject
    * <a target="_blank" href="https://leo-project.net/leofs/download.html">CentOS 6.x, 7.x</a>
    * <a target="_blank" href="https://leo-project.net/leofs/download.html">Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04</a>
* Community
    * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freshports.org/databases/leofs">FreeBSD</a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/installation/quick/">Here</a> is the installation manual.


## Build LeoFS From Source (For Developers)

Here, we explain how to build LeoFS from source code.
First, you have to install the following packages to build Erlang and LeoFS.

```bash
## [CentOS]
$ sudo yum install libuuid-devel cmake check check-devel
## [Ubuntu]
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool libncurses5-dev libssl-dev cmake check
```

Then, install Erlang.

```bash
##
## 1. Install libatomic
##
$ wget http://www.ivmaisoft.com/_bin/atomic_ops/libatomic_ops-7.4.4.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf libatomic_ops-7.4.4.tar.gz
$ cd libatomic_ops-7.4.4
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ sudo make install

##
## 2. Install Erlang (18.3)
##
$ wget http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_18.3.tar.gz
$ tar xzf otp_src_18.3.tar.gz
$ cd otp_src_18.3
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/erlang/18.3 \
              --enable-smp-support \
              --enable-m64-build \
              --enable-halfword-emulator \
              --enable-kernel-poll \
              --without-javac \
              --disable-native-libs \
              --disable-hipe \
              --disable-sctp \
              --enable-threads \
              --with-libatomic_ops=/usr/local
$ make
$ sudo make install

##
## 3. Set PATH
##
$ vi ~/.profile
    ## append the follows:
    export ERL_HOME=/usr/local/erlang/18.3
    export PATH=$PATH:$ERL_HOME/bin

$ source ~/.profile
```

Then, clone source of LeoFS and libraries from GitHub.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leo-project/leofs.git
$ cd leofs
$ git checkout -b develop remotes/origin/develop
$ ./rebar get-deps
$ ./git_checkout.sh develop
```

Then, build LeoFS with the following commands.

```bash
$ make && make release_for_test
```

Now, you can find the LeoFS package as follow.

```bash
$ ls package/
leo_gateway/  leo_manager_0/  leo_manager_1/  leo_storage/  README.md
```

Then, we can start and access LeoFS with the following commands. Also, you're able to easily operate LeoFS with [leofs-adm](https://github.com/leo-project/leofs/blob/master/leofs-adm) script.

```bash
$ package/leo_manager_0/bin/leo_manager start
$ package/leo_manager_1/bin/leo_manager start
$ package/leo_storage/bin/leo_storage start
$ package/leo_gateway/bin/leo_gateway start
$ ./leofs-adm status
